# RealTime-Pose-Estimation
Human pose estimation from video or a real-time feed plays a crucial role in various fields such as full-body gesture control, quantifying physical exercise, and sign language recognition. For example, it can be used as the base model for fitness, yoga, and dance applications. It finds its major part in augmented reality.  Media Pipe Pose is a framework for high-fidelity body pose tracking, which takes input from RGB video frames and infers 33 3D landmarks on the whole human. Current state-of-the-art approach methods rely primarily on powerful desktop environments for inferencing, whereas this method outperforms other methods and achieves very good results in real-time.
